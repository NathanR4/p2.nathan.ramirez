  The sketch below has the general information such as calendar, news, text mesesage, social feed notifications, clock, and weather.
  For the health related information I included sleep, weight, and steps.

  In my implementation I decided to go with csv files for all of my inputs. Weather, health measurements, calendar events, text messages and social notifications all come from csv files. I ended up having some of the different information on the same tile, for example social feed notifications and text messages are on one tile and the sleep, weight, and step records are on one also.

     In terms of advanced features I created the tiles so that they can be moved around and enabled/disabled. The user can press on the button at the bottom left to open another panel which will then show users which tiles are enabled and will allow them to turn them on and off.
