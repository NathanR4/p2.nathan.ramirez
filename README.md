  The sketch below has the general information such as calendar, news, text mesesage, social feed notifications, clock, and weather.
  For the health related information I included sleep, weight, and steps. I wanted to keep the tiles for the information as small as they can be while ensuring the
  user could still read information on them, since it is a mirror there should be plenty of mirror space. I also wanted to keep their design similar, the tiles all 
  have the same general apperance but are formatted differently in some areas to properly show their data.

  In my implementation I decided to go with csv files for all of my inputs. Weather, health measurements, calendar events, text messages and social notifications all come from csv files. I ended up having some of the different information on the same tile, for example social feed notifications and text messages are on one tile and the sleep, weight, and step records are on one also. The health display will only show five days at a time. But the calendar and time tiles will show the current day and time.

  In terms of advanced features I created the tiles so that they can be moved around and enabled/disabled. The user can press on the button at the bottom left to open another panel which will then show users which tiles are enabled and will allow them to turn them on and off. I decided to go with this extra feature as its primary function is to act as a mirror so if users need the extra mirror space or don't want to see certain tiles, they can move them around or just disable them until they want to see them again.
